Please note that we accept requests in English language only. All messages on another languages wouldn't be accepted. 

Also, emails which are reporting about plugin's bugs are accepted for investigation and fixing. Your request must contain URL of the website, issues description and WordPress admin panel access. Plugin customization based on your Wordpress theme is a paid service (standard price is $10, but it could be higer and depends on the complexity of requested changes). We will analize existing issue and make necessary changes after 100% pre-payment.All these paid changes and modifications could be included to the next version of plugin and will be shared for all users like an integral part of the plugin. Free fixing services will be provided for user who send translation on their native language (this should be a new translation of a certain plugin, and you can check available translations on the official plugin page).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `Contact Form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress admin panel.
3. You can adjust necessary settings through your WordPress admin panel in "Settings" > "Contact Form".
4. Create a page or a post and insert shortcode [contact_form] to the text.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where I can find settings to adjust work of the plugin after activation? =

In the 'Plugin' menu you can find a link to the settings page.

= After plugin installation I haven't adjusted the settings. What is the default email address which will be used for a contact via the form? =

Default address which was specified during WordPress installation will be used by the Contact Form plugin as the default email address.

= How can I add Contact Form to my website? =

You need to put [contact_form] shortcode into your page or some post.

= After user is choosen via plugin settings page I have got this error: "Please input correct email. Settings are not saved." =

This means that you have made a syntax error.

= How to use other language files with the Contact Form? = 

Here is an example for German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set the WP version to the required language and in configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure that there are files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the plugin (in the languages folder which is in the root of the plugin).

3. If there are no such files it will be necessary to copy other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in the both files).

4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please load this program, install it, open the file with this program (required language file) and for each line in English write translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in admin panel and on the frontend.
